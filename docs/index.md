# Welcome to Curve Fit!

## Background

`CurveFit` is a Python package for fitting curves using nonlinear mixed effects. It can be used to do only that if desired.
However, due to its current usage for the [IHME COVID-19 project](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america),
 it has modules specifically for evaluating model performance out beyond the range of time observed in the data.
 Likewise, it has modules for creating uncertainty intervals based on out of sample performance.

In our [methods documentation](methods.md) we discuss the statistical methods for `CurveFit`.
In our [code documentation](code.md), we explain the core model code and also the extensions that allow for 
evaluating model performance and generating uncertainty intervals.

*NOTE: This documentation is currently under construction and being updated regularly.*

Please note that this code base makes up only one part of the IHME COVID-19 projection process, in particular the
 COVID-19 deaths forecasting.

## Getting Started

To clone the repository and get
started, you can either do

```
git clone https://github.com/ihmeuw-msca/CurveFit.git
cd CurveFit
make install
```

### A Note on `cppad_py`

One of the dependencies for this package is cppad_py, a python interface for algorithmic differentiation.
If you experience issues installing or importing `cppad_py` after doing `make install`, 
please see [this page](https://github.com/bradbell/cppad_py) to clone and debug the build for `cppad_py`
with `setup.py`.
